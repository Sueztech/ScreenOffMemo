# ScreenOffMemo
A replacement for Samsung's Screen Off Memo that works on custom ROMs/older devices.

---
On custom ROMs, depends on [CM S Pen Add-on](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tushar.cmspen2&hl=en) to detect S Pen events. Should work on all devices/ROMs that CM S Pen Add-on works on.

Confirmed working on:
- SM-N910V (EmotionOS 7.1.1)
- SM-N910P (EmotionOS 6.0.1)
